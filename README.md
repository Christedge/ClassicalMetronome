# Classical Metronome

A spike of a metronome app that just provides the most essential features.

## Features

* Precise timing, e.g. the gap between two beats is a constant time without any variances due to operating system latencies.
* Distraction free user interface, e.g. without moving or blinking user interface controls.
* Support for portrait and landscape modes as well as handset and tablet devices. 
* Straightforward usage. The features should be as simple to use as possible. Start/Stop should be available even in case the device is placed at some distance.
* Support for tapping in the tempo (by touching the tempo display multiple times).
* Familiar timbre (of course, de gustibus non est disputandum :) .
