# Classical Metronome

A metronome that just provides the most essential features.

## Product Vision

For practising musicians, who want to improve their rhythmic capabilities, Classical Metronome is a Metronome app that is distraction free and straightforward to use. Unlike other metronome apps, Classical Metronome excels at its absolutely precise timing and its familiar analog sound of a traditional metronome.
